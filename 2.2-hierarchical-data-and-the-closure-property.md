# 2.2 Hierarchical Data and the Closure Property

## 2.2.1 Representing Sequences

This section shows how pairs can be nested to form list sequences and also the `list` procedure to simplify the code.

```scheme
; the list 1 2 3 4 is finished with '() to mark the end
(define xs (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 (cons 4 '())))))

; a simpler but equivalent way to create the same list
(define xs (list 1 2 3 4))

; another simple and equivalent way to create xs
(define xs '(1 2 3 4))
```

Some useful procedures operating on lists are also demonstrated.

```scheme
; check whether list is empty
(null? xs)

; get nth value of list
(list-ref xs 1)

; length of list
(length xs)

; fuse two lists together
(define xs (append (list 1 2) (list 3 4)))

; map over a list and apply the given procedure on each element
(map (lambda (i) (* i i)) xs)
```

A spread operator represents parameters as a list.

```scheme
(define (f x . y) (+ x (length y)))

; returns 8
(f 4 0 0 0 0)
```

## 2.2.2 Hierarchical Structures

This section covers that a list of lists can be composed to form trees.

```scheme
(define ts (list 1 2 (list 3 (list 4 5)) 6 7))
```

## 2.2.3 Sequences as Conventional Interfaces

This section covers the `map`, `filter`, `fold` -trinity.

## 2.2.4 Example: A Picture Language

This section covers how to manipulate pictures with code. Again, I'm not too interested in this so I'm skipping it for now.
