# 2.5  Systems with Generic Operations

This chapter basically extends the data directed programming pattern from chapter 2.4. I don't find it enormously interesting. There was a section on subtypes and supertypes, eg integers are part of the rationals, rationals are part of the reals, reals part of the are complex numbers.

I'm going to skip the details of this chapter for now.
