# 2.1 Introduction to Data Abstraction

## 2.1.1 Example: Arithmetic Operations for Rational Numbers

This section demonstrates how to implement rational numbers which is cool but I'm not going to show it here. It does however demonstrate a basic data structure known as a `pair` with which we can build single-linked lists.

```scheme
; cons constructs a pair
(define xs (cons 2 3))

; car returns the head of a pair
(car xs)

; cdr returns the tail of a pair
(cdr xs)
```

*The names `car` and `cdr` are living fossils of computer science and they stand for "content of address register" and "content of decrement register" respectively.*

## 2.1.2 Abstraction Barriers

This section explains an interesting idea about how we should distinguish between procedures implementing a data abstraction and procedures uses a data abstraction. In the examples of pairs, `cons`, `car` and `cdr` are examples of procedures using the pair data structure whereas there could be whoknowswhat procedures that make pairs possible which we don't care about.

## 2.1.3 What Is Meant by Data?

This section talks about what we should think of as data and what we shouldn't think of as data. For example a pair might include information under the hood for its proper operation but we don't consider that data because we don't see or use it in our programs.

## 2.1.4 Extended Exercise: Interval Arithmetic

This section is an exercise that I don't find particularly interesting right now so I'm skipping it here.
